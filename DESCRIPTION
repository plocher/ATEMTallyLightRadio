Tally Light control using RFM69 data radios and AdaFruit RadioFeathers

Inspired by the BMD SDI shield and Skaarhoj's ATEM demo code
and work done by kvITkoConsulting back in 2016

This code is a new implementation using Adafruit's Featherwing processors with RFM69 radios and NeoPixels
The "transmitter" uses an Ethernet Shield to connect to the network that the ATEM switch is also on,
though a WiFi shield/processor could also be used if mobility is a concern.

I fabricated a couple of PCBs that make assembling and deploying these tally lights easier.  See ATEM-Tally-Camera-Light and ATEM-Tally-SDI in the SPCoast.com eagle repository.

Notes:
  * Be sure to use the regular RGB NeoPixels and not the RGBW version
  * In my use case, the on camera team kept thinking that "green means go" and looked at the wrong "preview" camera, so the code minimizes the green and idle/blue display.
  * the SDI / transmitter code doesn't resend tally indications unless the selections change, which means that an on-camera display card won't display anything until the ATEM cameras change.  It wouldn't be hard to have the code resend a radio packet on some infrequent basis if this were to become an issue...
